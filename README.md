# 🌳 vriksha-os-core
**The Intelligent Operating System for Natural & Vrikshayurvedic Farming.**

**Mission:** To digitize 2,500 years of Indian plant wisdom into a scalable AI engine that solves crop diseases using local, organic resources and data-driven precision.

## 🛠️ System Architecture: The Acharya-Shishya Model
Vriksha-OS is built on a **Master-Apprentice (Distillation) framework**:
1. **Acharya (The Teacher):** Powered by Gemini 3 Flash. Handles high-level diagnosis and "Synthetic Wisdom" extraction from ancient texts and global experts.
2. **Shishya (The Student):** A custom, lightweight ML model designed to run locally on the farm once trained on 1,000+ verified "Ground Truth" rows.

## 🚦 Roadmap: Feature Status & Vision (2026)

### **Phase 1: Industrial Foundation (IN PROGRESS ⏳)**
- [x] **Master DB Connection:** Established Google Sheets/Script bridge.
- [ ] **Acharya-Rotator:** Automated switching between 5–10 Google Cloud Project keys to ensure zero downtime (prevents `429 Busy` errors).
- [ ] **Assembly Line Folders:** - `/Tri_Pending`: For raw, unprocessed field audits.
    - `/Tri_Training_Data`: For AI-labeled, sorted, and "Verified Gold" images.
- [ ] **Vriksha Knowledge Tab:** A verified database of traditional remedies (Neem, Bitter Plants, Fish Waste) for cross-referencing.

### **Phase 2: Field Intelligence (PLANNED 🗓)**
- [ ] **Field WebApp:** 3-click mobile interface for GPS, Image, and Video capture.
- [ ] **Jala-Check (Mobile Water Lab):** AI-powered "Bubble Test" and "Limescale Scan" to assess water hardness before diagnosis.
- [ ] **GPS/Soil Integration:** Automatic soil-type tagging (Red, Black, Alluvial, Laterite) using Geospatial APIs.
- [ ] **Dynamic Pharmacy:** Context-aware ingredient checklists that adapt based on the detected disease.

### **Phase 3: The Growth Loop (PLANNED 🗓)**
- [ ] **Shruti (Knowledge Scraper):** Automated YouTube transcript extraction + Comment Sentiment Analysis to find community-verified hidden gems.
- [ ] **Synthetic Linker:** Automatically pairing YouTube "Text Wisdom" with existing library "Visual Photos."
- [ ] **Judge Dashboard:** A UI to Approve/Edit prescriptions based on AI Confidence Scores.
- [ ] **Visual Recovery Bot:** WhatsApp follow-ups + "Before/After" AI image comparison for auto-verification of treatments.

## 🏷️ Data Integrity & Source Tagging
To ensure high-value traceability for international AgTech buyers, every row is tagged:
* **Field-Real:** Audits from Jayeone Farms & local partners. (Highest Value)
* **Scrape-Verified:** Wisdom extracted via "Shruti" and matched against Vrikshayurveda PDFs.
* **Synthetic-AI:** Logic scenarios generated to bridge data gaps for rare diseases.

---

## 🛡️ Core Guardrails
* **The 85% Confidence Rule:** Automatic fallback to Acharya (Teacher) if Shishya (Student) confidence is low.
* **Water Salinity Correction:** Automatic modification of remedies (e.g., swapping milk for buttermilk) in high-salt soil conditions.
* **The Bitter Principle (Tikta):** Prioritizing non-chemical, high-bitterness plants for pest and virus immunity.
